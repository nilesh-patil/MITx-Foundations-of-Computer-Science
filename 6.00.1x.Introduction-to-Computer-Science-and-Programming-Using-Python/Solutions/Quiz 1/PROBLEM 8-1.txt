PROBLEM 8-1  (5.0/5.0 points)
Successive approximation is a general method in which on each iteration of an algorithm, we find a closer estimate of the answer for which we are seeking. One class of successive approximation algorithms uses the idea of a fixed point. If f(x) is a mathematical function, then finding the x such that f(x) = x gives us the fixed point of f.

One way to find a fixed point is to start with some guess (e.g. guess = 1.0) and, if this is not good enough, use as a next guess the value of f(guess). We can keep repeating this process until we get a guess that is within epsilon of f(guess).

Here is a slightly incorrect definition of this function:

def fixedPoint(f, epsilon):
    """
    f: a function of one argument that returns a float
    epsilon: a small float
  
    returns the best guess when that guess is less than epsilon 
    away from f(guess) or after 100 trials, whichever comes first.
    """
    guess = 1.0
    for i in range(100):
        if f(guess) - guess < epsilon:
            return guess
        else:
            guess = f(guess)
    return guess
This function definition has a bug in it. You can fix this by correcting exactly one line of the definition. Please do so in the box below.
